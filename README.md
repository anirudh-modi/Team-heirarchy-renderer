# team-heirarchy-renderer

This is a tree render, which takes object named `rootNode` present within the `src/config/config.js` file and renders a expandable and collapsable tree.

To run the application, kindly download the github repo, and run `npm install` within the **root folder**. 
Once the installation is completed, run the command mentioned below :
`npm start` and in your browser open the url `localhost:8080`. To see the application running.

To change the tree structure, edit the `rootNode` object present in `src/config/config.js` file, where to add multiple child can be added to a node within the `immediateEmployee` array present for each node.
